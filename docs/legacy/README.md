# Legacy Documentation

These files were moved here from the `Documentation/` folder (root level) on 2026-02-26.

They are **not the authoritative source** for any feature. The canonical documentation lives in `docs/` (the parent folder).

These files are preserved for historical reference — some contain original design thinking and feature decisions that may be useful context when working on related areas.
